# P-99: Ninety-Nine Prolog Solutions

To learn Prolog, I'm working through the [P-99: Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems). Each problem's solution is in the file with the same problem number. For example, the solution to [p01.pl](archive/p01.pl) is [s01.pl](s01.pl).

In the `archive` folder, you can find the original problems in markdown and PDF format.
